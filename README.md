## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was great for implementing all the knowledge and skills I've developed over the last month or so.

### Continued development

I really want to continue improving on my knowledge of pseudoelements, and how to position them precisely. This is particularly the case for the background glow element in the hero section.
